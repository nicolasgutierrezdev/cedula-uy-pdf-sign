# Trust anchors and certificate pinning

How `firmauy` establishes trust when verifying cédula signatures: the national CA certificates it
uses, how they are pinned, how to refresh them, and the current state of revocation.

For everyday use you do not need any of this: the certificates are bundled and verification works
offline out of the box. This document is the deep dive.

## Bundled certificates, verified against pinned fingerprints

The package **bundles** the two national CA certificates as built-in trust anchors (public
certificates, see [`data/PROVENANCE.md`](https://github.com/carlosplanchon/firmauy/blob/main/src/firmauy/data/PROVENANCE.md)).
Verification uses them automatically, so it works offline with no setup; `firmauy fetch-cas` can
refresh them from the sources below into a per-user cache (which then takes precedence over the
bundled copies).

Every certificate on the *national-CA path* (bundled, cached, downloaded, or seeded via
`--from-file`) is verified against a pinned SHA-256 fingerprint, and the intermediate is
additionally checked to be signed by the root, so the origin of those bytes never matters.
(`--ca-file` is different: it lets you supply your *own* trust anchors for verification, so it is
intentionally **not** pinned, the whole point being to trust a set you chose.)

| Certificate | Source(s), tried in order |
|---|---|
| AC Raíz Nacional de Uruguay (AGESIC) | `https://www.uce.gub.uy/acrn/acrn.cer` |
| AC Ministerio del Interior (intermediate) | `https://ca.minterior.gub.uy/certificados/MICA.cer` (official), then `https://crt.sh/?d=29172099` (fallback) |

> **Note on the intermediate source.** The Ministerio del Interior CA repository
> (`ca.minterior.gub.uy`) has been decommissioned and now returns `HTTP 501` for every
> request, and AGESIC's trust-list page still points at that dead URL. `fetch-cas`
> therefore falls back to the **byte-identical** copy in the public Certificate
> Transparency log (crt.sh), retrying transient errors. This is safe regardless of the
> source: the bytes are accepted only if they match the pinned fingerprint below *and*
> are signed by the pinned root. If the official server is restored, it is used first.

## `fetch-cas` (optional)

`fetch-cas` is **optional**: verification already uses the bundled certificates; it only
refreshes a per-user cache. If you do run it and crt.sh is flaky, you can seed the intermediate
from a local copy with `--from-file` instead of downloading. The fingerprint pin makes the
file's origin irrelevant; a copy that doesn't match a pin is ignored and downloaded instead:

```bash
# Seed the intermediate from a local file; the root still downloads (it is reliable)
firmauy fetch-cas --from-file mica.pem

# Fully offline: supply both (a bundle, or repeat --from-file)
firmauy fetch-cas --from-file acrn.pem --from-file mica.pem
```

Any certificate matching a pinned fingerprint is taken from the supplied file(s) instead of
being downloaded. (The cédula middleware does **not** install these certificates, and the
package already bundles them, so you rarely need this.)

## Pinned fingerprints

SHA-256 of each certificate (DER):

```text
root (ACRN):         5533a0401f612c688ebce5bf53f2ec14a734eb178bfae00e50e85dae6723078a
intermediate (MICA): a29cad5c89aa49cff81f17f45c42fd44685510246d9ab5d031448e2fda2517be
```

You can audit them yourself:

```bash
# Root, from the official source:
curl -s https://www.uce.gub.uy/acrn/acrn.cer | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256
# SHA256 Fingerprint=55:33:A0:40:...:8A  (same bytes, openssl prints them upper-case with colons)

# Intermediate, from the Certificate Transparency log:
curl -s -A "firmauy (+https://pypi.org/project/cedula-uy-pdf-sign)" "https://crt.sh/?d=29172099" \
  | openssl x509 -noout -fingerprint -sha256
# SHA256 Fingerprint=A2:9C:AD:5C:...:BE
```

## Revocation (CRL/OCSP)

Revocation checking is **off by default** (offline). With `--check-revocation`, verification
fetches revocation data and fails the chain (`hard-fail`) if the certificate is revoked or that
data cannot be obtained.

For **cédula** signatures, `--check-revocation` currently **cannot succeed**: the leaf
certificate's CRL distribution point is on the Ministerio del Interior server
(`ca.minterior.gub.uy`), which has been decommissioned and returns `HTTP 501`. Since revocation
is `hard-fail`, unreachable revocation data fails the chain. Use the default
(no `--check-revocation`) until the CRL endpoint is restored.

## Validity over time

A basic (BES) signature carries no trusted timestamp, so certificate validity and revocation are
evaluated **at verification time**, not at signing time. A timestamp (PAdES-T / XAdES-T / CAdES-T,
added with `--tsa-url`) provides independent trusted-time evidence of when the signature existed.

On the verification side, that evidence is only as good as the timestamp's own validation. For PDF
(PAdES-T) and CMS (CAdES-T), pyHanko checks the embedded timestamp against the active trust
anchors, so it counts as trusted time only when the TSA's CA is among them (e.g. supplied via
`--ca-file`). For XML (XAdES-T), `firmauy verify-xml` confirms by default only that the timestamp
**binds to the signature**; it does **not** validate the TSA's certificate, so the reported
`genTime` is what the (unverified) TSA asserts. Pass **`--tsa-ca <tsa-bundle.pem>`** to validate the
RFC 3161 token against the timestamping authority's certificate: on success the `genTime` becomes
trusted and the signing certificate is then evaluated **at that time** instead of now (long-term
validation), so a signature stays VALID even after the signer's certificate later expires.

There is no national list of trusted timestamping authorities to bundle (unlike the national CA),
so `--tsa-ca` is bring-your-own: supply the CA of whichever TSA you used. Embedding revocation data
at signing time (the AdES `-LT` / `-LTA` levels, for full archival validation) is out of scope and,
for the cédula, currently impossible anyway since the Ministerio del Interior CRL endpoint is
decommissioned.

The bundled national CA certificates expire (2031) and can be rotated by the issuer; re-run
`firmauy fetch-cas` to refresh from the network, or use `--ca-file`.
