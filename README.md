## Quick start

> Requires **Linux** with the Uruguayan cédula PKCS#11 middleware installed. The full smart-card setup is in [Requirements](#requirements) and [Setup on Arch Linux](#setup-on-arch-linux).

```bash
uv tool install cedula-uy-pdf-sign     # install
firmauy list-tokens                    # verify the card is detected
firmauy sign input.pdf                 # sign -> input_firmado.pdf (prompts for the PIN)
```

## Overview

`cedula-uy-pdf-sign` provides a local, developer-oriented workflow for signing PDF documents with a Uruguayan national ID card using PKCS#11 middleware.

The CLI tool is invoked as `firmauy` and supports:

- signing individual PDF documents
- batch-signing multiple PDFs with a single PKCS#11 session
- configuring the visible signature position
- selecting the signature page
- discovering available PKCS#11 tokens and certificates
- non-interactive PIN sources for controlled automation workflows

## Requirements

### Hardware

- Smart card reader compatible with your OS
- Uruguayan ID card (cédula) with active certificate

### Operating system

This tool targets **Linux** and is primarily developed and tested on **Arch Linux**.

Other Linux distributions may work if the required smart card stack, PKCS#11 middleware, and Python environment are correctly configured.

**Windows and macOS are not supported.**

### Python

Python **3.10 or newer**.

### PKCS#11 middleware

The default PKCS#11 module expected by this tool is:

```text
/usr/lib/pkcs11/libgclib.so
```

On Arch Linux, this is provided by the `cedula-uruguay-pkcs11` AUR package.

## Setup on Arch Linux

### 1. Install smart card stack

```bash
sudo pacman -S pcsclite ccid pcsc-tools opensc
sudo systemctl enable --now pcscd
```

### 2. Install PKCS#11 library for the Uruguayan ID card

Install the PKCS#11 module from AUR:

```bash
yay -S cedula-uruguay-pkcs11
# or manually:
# https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cedula-uruguay-pkcs11
```

This is a **community-maintained** AUR package that repackages the official cédula drivers distributed by the Uruguayan government. It is not an official government package.

It provides the default PKCS#11 module used by this tool:

```text
/usr/lib/pkcs11/libgclib.so
```

## Installation

### Installation with uv

```bash
uv tool install cedula-uy-pdf-sign
```

## Usage

The CLI tool is invoked as `firmauy`.

### CLI help

Use `--help` on any command to see all available options:

```bash
firmauy --help
firmauy sign --help
firmauy sign-batch --help
```

### Sign a single PDF

```bash
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf
```

The tool will prompt for the PKCS#11 PIN interactively.

If the output path is omitted, the signed file is saved as:

```text
<input>_firmado.pdf
```

### Custom signature position

```bash
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --x1 20 --y1 20 --x2 225 --y2 90
```

### Specify page

Pages are 0-indexed. Use `-1` to sign the last page.

```bash
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --page 0
```

### Non-interactive PIN

PIN can be supplied without an interactive prompt via `--pin-source`:

```bash
# From an environment variable
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --pin-source env --pin-env-var MY_PIN

# From stdin
echo "1234" | firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --pin-source stdin

# From a file descriptor
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --pin-source fd --pin-fd 3
```

⚠️ Avoid exposing the PIN in shell history or process lists.

### Timestamping (TSA, optional)

Embed a trusted timestamp from a Time Stamping Authority:

```bash
firmauy sign input.pdf output_signed.pdf --tsa-url https://your-tsa/endpoint
```

TSA timestamping is **optional** and is **not required** for the standard Uruguayan cédula signing flow. It adds independent, trusted-time evidence to the signature and may involve an external network request.

### Sign batch

Sign multiple PDFs with a single PKCS#11 session. The card PIN is entered only once.

```bash
# Explicit file list
firmauy sign-batch file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf --output-dir ~/signed

# Whole directory
firmauy sign-batch --input-dir ~/docs --output-dir ~/signed

# Whole directory, recursively
firmauy sign-batch --input-dir ~/docs --recursive --output-dir ~/signed

# Both can be combined
firmauy sign-batch extra.pdf --input-dir ~/docs --output-dir ~/signed
```

Output files are named `<original-name>_firmado.pdf` by default.

Change the suffix with `--suffix`:

```bash
firmauy sign-batch --input-dir ~/docs --output-dir ~/signed --suffix _signed
```

The output directory is created automatically if it does not exist.

All options available for `sign` (position, PIN source, reason, TSA, etc.) are also available for `sign-batch`.

⚠️ This tool produces cryptographic signatures. Legal validity depends on applicable regulations and use context.

Make sure you have reviewed all documents before signing them in batch.

### Discover tokens and certificates

List all visible PKCS#11 tokens:

```bash
firmauy list-tokens
```

List certificates available on a token:

```bash
firmauy list-certs
```

## Security considerations

- Never pass the PIN directly as a command-line argument.
- Prefer interactive PIN entry for manual use.
- For automation, prefer protected file descriptors or controlled environments.
- Review every document before signing it.
- Use batch signing only in trusted workflows.
- Keep your smart card, reader, PIN, and PKCS#11 middleware under your own control.

## Privacy

This tool is designed to run entirely locally.

It does not collect, transmit, or store any user data externally.

All cryptographic operations are performed on the user's machine and/or the connected smart card.

Note: Optional features such as timestamping (TSA) may involve external network requests, depending on user configuration.

## Signature verification

Signed documents can be independently verified using external tools, such as the official validator provided by AGESIC (no affiliation implied):

[https://firma.gub.uy/](https://firma.gub.uy/)

Note that a successful **technical** verification does not by itself imply **legal** validity for every use case. See [Legal and compliance](#legal-and-compliance).

## Known issues

### Incorrect PIN may crash the process (middleware bug)

On Arch Linux, entering an incorrect PIN may cause the process to terminate abruptly with:

```text
*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
```

This is a **bug in the PKCS#11 middleware** (`libgclib.so`), not in `cedula-uy-pdf-sign`.

The middleware correctly returns `CKR_PIN_INCORRECT` to the caller, but then appears to corrupt its own memory during error handling.

This is independently reproducible with `pkcs11-tool`:

```bash
pkcs11-tool --module /usr/lib/pkcs11/libgclib.so --login --test
# With wrong PIN -> process crashes with stack smash
```

Because the crash occurs inside native code, it cannot be caught or recovered from at the Python level.

**Practical advice:** double-check your PIN before invoking `firmauy`.

This behavior is outside the control of this application.

## Additional notes

- The default visual signature appearance was derived by analyzing documents signed with official software.
- This project focuses on practical interoperability rather than strict compliance with any specific implementation.

## Legal and compliance

This project is copyright-registered, experimental, community-maintained, and not officially certified.

It is intended for developers and technically proficient users who understand the implications of using smart cards, PKCS#11 middleware, and digital signatures.

**This project:**

- is **not affiliated with or endorsed by AGESIC**
- does **not** claim official certification or compliance
- does **not** guarantee the legal validity of generated signatures
- is provided **for technical and educational purposes**

While it uses standard cryptographic mechanisms and aims to align with Uruguayan digital signature practices, the generated signatures should not be assumed valid for legal or regulatory use without independent verification. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that generated signatures meet any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to their use case.

### Intended use

Local, developer-oriented PDF signing using a Uruguayan ID card through PKCS#11. It is especially aimed at users who want to:

- sign PDF documents locally
- understand and reproduce a PKCS#11-based signing workflow
- experiment with smart card integration on Linux
- build automation around PDF signing under their own responsibility

It is **not** intended to replace official, certified, or legally guaranteed signing platforms.

### Scope

This tool focuses on technical integration with PKCS#11, PDF signing workflows, and reproducibility of signature appearance.

It does **not** validate certificates against official trust lists, provide legal guarantees, or replace certified signing platforms.

This registration concerns the authorship of the software as a copyrighted work. It does **not** imply official certification, endorsement, legal validity of generated signatures, or regulatory compliance of any specific use case. See [Legal and compliance](#legal-and-compliance).

## Development

The project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for environment and dependency management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/carlosplanchon/cedula-uy-pdf-sign.git
cd cedula-uy-pdf-sign

# Create the environment and install dependencies (runtime + dev)
uv sync

# Run the test suite
uv run pytest

# Run the CLI from the working tree
uv run firmauy --help
```

The package source lives under `src/cedula_uy_pdf_sign/`; tests under `tests/`.

### Testing without the real card (SoftHSM2)

Entering the wrong PIN too many times **blocks the cédula**, so you should not develop against the real card. Instead, you can run the full signing pipeline against a software PKCS#11 token (SoftHSM2) that mimics a cédula closely enough to exercise token discovery, certificate selection, PIN handling and signing.

```bash
# Arch Linux: install the software token + tooling
sudo pacman -S softhsm opensc openssl

# Provision a throwaway "fake cédula" token under ./.softhsm
bash scripts/dev-softhsm-setup.sh
```

The script prints ready-to-run `firmauy list-certs` / `firmauy sign` commands pointing at the SoftHSM module. The resulting PDF is a cryptographically valid signature, but it will **not** validate as a *cédula* signature on [firma.gub.uy](https://firma.gub.uy/) (the issuing CA is a local fake, by design). Reset everything with `rm -rf .softhsm`.

The same setup powers a set of end-to-end integration tests (`tests/test_integration_pkcs11.py`) that exercise the real PKCS#11 path: signing plus cryptographic verification of the resulting PDF, and the selection/error branches that are unsafe to reproduce on the real card (expired certificate, certificate without a private key, multiple tokens, certificate scoring and `--cert-id` override). They are **skipped automatically** when SoftHSM2 / OpenSC / OpenSSL are not installed, so `uv run pytest` works either way.
